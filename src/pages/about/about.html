		<p>Data breaches have gained widespread attention in the media recently as businesses of all sizes and types (including government and charities) become totally reliant on digital storage and cloud computing. Sensitive data is being stored on cloud-based servers, making it a goldmine for anyone able to gain access. Recently, there has been an explosion in the number of data breaches being publicly disclosed and that is where pwned? comes in!</p>

		<p>pwned? searches <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?</a> (created by <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt</a>), which is a free resource for anyone to quickly see if they may have been put at risk due to an online account of theirs having been compromised or "pwned" in a data breach.</p>

		<p>pwned? was created by <a href="https://www.leightley.com">Daniel Leightley</a>, a Post-Doctoral Research Associate working on a range of big data and cloud projects for use in military health. The app is documented at his site <a href="https://www.leightley.com">here</a>.
