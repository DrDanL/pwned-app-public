    <ion-card-content>
      Password managers remove both of these problems by generating and storing complex passwords for you. The password manager lives in a browser (or app) and acts a digital gatekeeper, filling in your login info when you need to get on a certain site. You just
      have to remember one (very secure!) master password for the manager itself, and everything else is taken care of for you.
